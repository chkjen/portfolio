                <p>Nice to meet you! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Chuck, a full stack web developer.</p>
                <p>Since I graduated college in 2006 with an Associate in Applied Science: Program Engineering, I've been working on many fun and exciting projects. This has allowed me to learn many different technologies to create websites that are both engaging and captive to users. I find myself to be both highly adaptive as well as quick to learn new technologies. </p>
                <p>Recently, in an effort to expand my knowledge, I completed a full stack web development bootcamp on Udemy (December 2019). This bootcamp included technologies from the following areas: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript ES6, DOM maniulation, JQuery, Unix Command Line, Node.js, Express, Git/GitHub version control, API creation/connection and RESTful methodology, EJS, Databases (SQL & MongoDB), Mongoose, Authentication and Security and React.js.</p>
                <p>I thouroughly enjoy complex projects that test and expand my coding and development skills. I enjoy working with a group of people on projects the most. That being said, I'm fully capable of working autonmously to complete projects.</p>
                <p>One of my most exciting goals for this year is to colaborate more on open source projects to give back to the community for all the learning they've provided. I also have several side projects that I'm working that will help grow my knowledge of SEO and online sales as well as API creation.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by! I hope to hear from you. Along with more details about my capabilities, there is a contact form below if you would like to reach me there. Have great day!</p>
